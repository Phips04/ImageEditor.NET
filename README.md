# ImageEditor.NET
The ImageEditor class is a static class written in C# that needs to be supplemented with individual code in order to do its job.
The class allows you to create images programmatically by setting the colors of pixels in a bitmap.
The two static methods of the class are each twice overloaded, the first one can be used to create a new image from scratch,
the heigth and width of the image must be specified in any case. Depending on the overload you use, you can either save it as a file directly,
or continue using it in your program as a bitmap variable. The second method lets you create images derived from existing ones e.g. special copies.
